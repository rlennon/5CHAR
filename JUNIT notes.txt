What is JUnit?
JUnit is a java framework tester which is part of the Unit testing family. It
is used to figure out whether code is fit for it's purpose. It tests code when
the programmer put an @ code before the method. 
Examples of the @'s are 
- @test - which tests the methods in the classes runtime
- @beforeclass - which test the methods before the class
- @before - tests methods before all methods with @test
- @after - tests methods after all the @test methods
- @afterclass - which tests after the class is done executing
